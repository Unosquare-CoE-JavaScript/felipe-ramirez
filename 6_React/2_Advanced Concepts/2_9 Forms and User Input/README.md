When To validate Forms

1. When form is submitted:
Allows the user to enter a valide value before warning them
Avoid unnecessary warning but may too late

2. When a input is losing focus
Allows the user to enter a valid value before warning
Very useful for untoched forms

3. On every keystroke
warns user before they had a chance of entering valid values
If applied only an invalid input has the potential of providing more direct feeback
